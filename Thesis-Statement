An n-gram language model can be used to find errors in source code resulting
in more precise reports of the location of errors. Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse
Document Frequency (TF-IDF) representation can be used to cluster crash
reports automatically, leading to clusters that are more representative of the
bugs that caused the crashes.
In order to evaluate the above thesis statement, I will use the MRR score
to measure how precise reports of the locations of errors are and the B-Cubed
F1-score to measure how representative buckets are of the bugs that caused
crashes.

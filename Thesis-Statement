An n-gram language model can be used to find errors in source code resulting
in more precise reports of the location of errors. Term Frequency–Inverse
Document Frequency (TF-IDF) representation can be used to cluster crash
reports automatically, leading to clusters that are more representative of the
bugs that caused the crashes.
In order to evaluate the above thesis statement, I will use the MRR score
to measure how precise reports of the locations of errors are and the B-Cubed
F1-score to measure how representative buckets are of the bugs that caused
crashes.


Static analysis can be used to optimize and measure the energy consumption of API usage in an app. This use of static analysis relieves developers from the effort of generating and executing test cases to obtain energy insights into their code.



Researchers should not just focus on the performance of SDP models but their practical applicability in real-world should be given more importance. SDP models should be designed considering their practical 

The main goal is to improve the productivity
of software developers as they undertake maintenance tasks.

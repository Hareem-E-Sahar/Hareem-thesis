% Title page and Table of Contents Tweaks %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Correct title for TOC
\renewcommand{\contentsname}{Table of Contents}

% Fill in the following
\title{Thesis Title} % Title can't use formulae, symbols, superscripts, subscripts, greek letters, etc. all of which should be replaced with word substitutes
\author{Author Name}

\degree{\MSc}
%\degree{\PhD} % uncomment respective degree

\dept{Computing Science}  % Write Computing Science or Civil Engineering.

% If you have a specialization, uncomment the following line and enter it below.
% It must correspond with what it says on Bear Tracks
% (Academics>My Academics>Graduation). If, like most people, you don't have one,
% just leave it commented.
%\field{Specialization Field}

% Put the year that you submitted your thesis below
\submissionyear{\number2017}

% Document Content  %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This is a modular document.
% The 'subfiles' package allows you to typeset the included
% documents separately from the main document, so that you
% can view only pieces of the thesis at a time.
% See https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Modular_Documents
%
% Subfiles that contain references: You can just run
% `biber subfilename` on them when compiling them individually.
% There is no need to make them reference the bibliography database
% 'refs.bib', as they inherit the reference from this file.

\begin{document}

\preamblepagenumbering % lower case roman numerals for early pages
\titlepage % adds title page. Can be commented out before submission if convenient

\subfile{\main/tex/abstract.tex}

\doublespacing
% \truedoublespacing
% \singlespacing
% \onehalfspacing

% A preface is not always required
\subfile{\main/tex/preface.tex}

% Below are the dedication page and the quote page. FGSR requirements are not
% clear on if you can have one of each or just one or the other. They do say to
% ask your supervisor if you should have them at all.
%
% The CS Department links to a comparison of pre- and post-Spring 2014 thesis
% guidelines (https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/graduate-studies/current-students/dissertation-guidelines)
% The comparison document lists an optional dedication page, but no quote page.

\singlespacing % Flip to single spacing for table of contents settings
               % This has been accepted in the past and shouldn't be a problem
               % Now the table of contents etc.
               
\tableofcontents
\listoftables  % only if you have any

%\end{listofsymbols}
               
% A glossary of terms is also optional,
% but no such functionality yet exists in this template.
               
% The rest of the document has to be at least one-half-spaced.
% Double-spacing is most common, but uncomment whichever you want, or 
% single-spacing if you just want to do that for your personal purposes.
% Long-quoted passages and footnotes can be in single spacing

\renewcommand\bibname{References}

\singlespacing % optional;  Bibliography is better in single spacing
               %            but you may choose different
               %            Don't use \singlespacing if your thesis

% Appendices are optional.

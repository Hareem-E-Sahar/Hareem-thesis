\chapter{Introduction}

Here is a test reference \cite{Knuth68:art_of_programming}.
These additional lines have been added just to demonstrate the spacing
for the rest of the document. Spacing will differ between the typeset main
document, and typeset individual documents, as the commands
to change spacing for the body of the thesis are only in the main document.

\section{Cross-Referencing}\label{sec:crossRef}

Cross-references between child documents are possible using the
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/xr-hyper}{\texttt{xr-hyper}} package.

Text on a new page, to test top margin size.
